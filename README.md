## Project Overview
This project aims to explore different parameters related to climate change. By analyzing
various aspects of the data, we aim to identify different trends and gain further insights into 
how the parameters affect each other and the overall changes they have undergone within the 
examined period.

## Data Source

Climate change data: The primary dataset for this analysis is the "climate_change_data.csv" file containing 
information about different atmospheric parameters from 2000 to 2024 across different countries.


## Tools
- Excel - 
- Jypter Notebook - Data cleaning, analysis, and Visualization


  ## Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase the following was done:
1. Data loading and Inspections
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and Formatting

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the climate change data to answer important questions such as:

- Is there a noticeable trend in temperature over time?
- How have CO2 emissions changed over the specified period?
- Is there a correlation between temperature and CO2 emissions?
- Are there strong correlations between temperature, CO2 emissions, sea level rise, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed?

## Data Analysis
``` python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

# Calculate the average temperature over time
average_temperature = df.groupby('Date')['CO2 Emissions'].mean().reset_index()

# Plot the line
sns.lineplot(x='Date', y='CO2 Emissions', data=average_temperature)

plt.title("Temporal Trend in CO2 Emissions")
plt.show()
```

## Results/Findings
- The fluctuating trend suggests variations in global CO2 emissions over time.
- The peaks likely correspond to periods of increased industrial activity, economic growth, or other factors contributing to higher emissions.
- The troughs may indicate efforts to reduce emissions, policy changes, or global events affecting energy consumption. eg, covid-19 which caused emissions to decrease around 2020-2021
- Canadaâ€™s sharp decline around 2005 and its consistently lower emissions compared to the USA highlight key differences between the two countries in their approach to managing CO2 emissions

## Recommendations
Based on the trends in CO2 emissions for Canada and the USA, here are some recommendations for both countries:
   - Continue Emission Reduction Efforts: Canada has made significant progress in reducing emissions since around 2005. To maintain this positive trend, the country should continue implementing policies and 
     initiatives aimed at further reducing CO2 emissions.
   - Strengthen International Cooperation: Collaborate with other nations to address global emissions collectively. International agreements and partnerships can accelerate emission reduction efforts.
